## Purpose
I had two main reasons to create this app:

### Learning
Inherent to anything we do, but I choosed this project because it will teach me a lot, like microservices, async processing and recommendations generation, and also help me to improve in already acquired skills

### Usefulness
I like to read books and I wanted to create an app related to this that I would want to use. Books searching, a personal bookshelf and recommendations. Simple, but useful.
